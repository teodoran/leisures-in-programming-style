Linq-based approach in C#
=========================
_A Linq-based example in .NET 5.0, with a liberal use of top-level statements._

Running the example
-------------------
To run this example, you'll need [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or higher.
Then, navigate into one of the folders, and run the program using `dotnet run`:

```shell
LinqBased $> dotnet run -- ../input.txt
live - 2
mostly - 2
white - 1
tigers - 1
india - 1
wild - 1
lions - 1
africa - 1
```

You can run the longer example, by using `pride-and-prejudice.txt`:

```shell
LinqBased $> dotnet run -- ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
